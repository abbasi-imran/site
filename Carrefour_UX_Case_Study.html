    <h1>Carrefour Digital UX Audit – Case Study</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In 2022, Carrefour approached us with a challenge: despite offering competitive services such as 60-minute delivery and personalized recommendations, their digital platforms—both web and app—were struggling with user engagement, usability, and satisfaction.</p>
    <p>My team conducted a comprehensive UX assessment covering the entire purchase journey, aiming to uncover usability issues, understand user behavior, benchmark against competitors, and deliver actionable recommendations to drive business impact.</p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify gaps and friction points across the end-to-end user experience</li>
        <li>Validate assumptions through primary and secondary research</li>
        <li>Benchmark Carrefour’s experience against top regional competitors</li>
        <li>Provide a roadmap of prioritized design improvements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p><strong>1. Expert Evaluation</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Heuristic Analysis (Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics)</li>
        <li>NCPI & VIMM models</li>
        <li>PET principles from Human Factors International</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>2. User Research</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 in-depth interviews with Carrefour customers</li>
        <li>Card sorting exercises and behavioral observations</li>
        <li>SUS (System Usability Scale) for quantitative insights</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>3. Competitive Benchmarking</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Assessed experiences across Talabat, Noon, Instashop, and Amazon</li>
        <li>Evaluated critical flows: Discovery → Decision → Checkout → Post-purchase</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Homepage overwhelmed users with over 40+ sections; “NOW” tag was unclear.</li>
        <li><strong>Decision-making:</strong> Inconsistent product descriptions and missing reviews/ratings.</li>
        <li><strong>Checkout:</strong> Multiple CTAs, confusing delivery info, and excessive red color usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-purchase:</strong> Incomplete orders and unclear substitution logic frustrated users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Personalized “My Store” experience based on shopping behavior</li>
        <li>Consistent product descriptions with reviews and visuals</li>
        <li>Visual refresh and more intuitive interaction patterns</li>
        <li>Greater transparency in product substitution process</li>
        <li>Simplified checkout with clearer CTAs and delivery info</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Business Impact Potential</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved retention and conversion rates</li>
        <li>Increased trust and satisfaction—especially for non-grocery items</li>
        <li>Higher customer lifetime value through loyalty and engagement</li>
        <li>Fewer service calls and support issues due to better transparency</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lookback (user testing)</li>
        <li>Figma / Sketch (prototyping)</li>
        <li>Google Forms (surveys)</li>
        <li>Excel / SPSS (data analysis)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>Carrefour’s leadership was presented with a detailed UX action plan backed by user research, expert analysis, and competitive insight. The recommendations aimed at driving both customer satisfaction and commercial performance, positioning Carrefour to better compete in the hyper-local eCommerce market.</p>
